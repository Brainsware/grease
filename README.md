Grease
======

Grease is a very minimalistic testing framework for PHP and was developed for testing [Bacon](http://baconphp.net) and [Sauce](https://github.com/Brainsware/sauce).

It currently supports three basic tests: throw, non-throw and asserts.

The output is formatted according to the [Test Anything Protocol (TAP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol).
